# Time-of-Flight Sensing Array## Hardware *  Arduino Uno board*  Time-of-FLight Sensor: [ Adafruit VL6180X](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-vl6180x-time-of-flight-micro-lidar-distance-sensor-breakout/overview)*  1-to-8 Multiplexer Breakout: [ Adafruit TCA9548A]( https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-tca9548a-1-to-8-i2c-multiplexer-breakout/overview)* Pull up resistors R = 4.7 Kilo Ohms (x2)## Sample codes * [Sample code to read VL6180X](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_VL6180X) *  [Sample codes to scan the ports of a multiplexer](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-tca9548a-1-to-8-i2c-multiplexer-breakout/wiring-and-test)*  [Sample code to scan the devices on an I2C bus](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/I2cScanner)## Reading an array of time-of-flight Sensors This [code](https://github.com/wanglong06/slrt-arduino-sensing-control/blob/master/Arduino/Read_Multiple_ToF_Sensors/Read_Multiple_ToF_Sensors.ino) is used to read a nxm array of VL180X time-of-flight sensors (where n = number of multiplexers, m = number of sensors per multiplexers). The maximum array size is 8x8. ## Changing the i2c address of multiplexer* A0 A1 A2 - these are the address selection pins for the multiplexer. By default the multiplexer is at address 0x70 and these three pins are pulled low. Connect them to Vin to set the address to 0x71 - 0x77.* A0 is the lowest-significant bit (if it is pulled high, it will increase the address by 1).* A1 is the 2nd-lowest-significant bit (if it is pulled high, it will increase the address by 2).* A2 is the 3rd-lowest-significant bit (if it is pulled high, it will increase the address by 4).* [Instructions of changing the i2c address of multiplexer](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-tca9548a-1-to-8-i2c-multiplexer-breakout/pinouts)
